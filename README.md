<h2>📓 Description</h2>
A pixel hunt game in which the player tries to find the specific characters on an image, similar to <b>Where's Waldo</b>.
When the player finds a character, they click on its position and select the correct character from the appeared list. 
If the clicked coordinates match the character's position, that character is marked as found.  
After finding all of the characters, player can submit their score on the leaderboard, which is stored on the backend, using MongoDB.
Leaderboard is sorted by time, so the incentive is to find the characters as fast as possible.
