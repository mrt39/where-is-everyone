<h2>üìì Description</h2>
Where is Everyone? is a pixel-hunt game inspired by <b>"Where's Waldo".</b> <br>
Player chooses one of three illustrated scenes and try to locate five hidden characters as quickly as possible. <br>
When the player finds a character, they click on its position and select the correct character from the appeared menu. If the clicked coordinates match the character's position, that character is marked as found. <br>
After finding all of the characters, player can submit their time to a global leaderboard backed by small Express + MongoDB API.
